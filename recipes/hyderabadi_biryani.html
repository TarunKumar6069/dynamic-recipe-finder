    <h3>This is most popular dish in India made with basmati rice and meat</h3>

    <p>
    Hyderabadi Biryani is a world-famous dish from the royal kitchens of Hyderabad, 
    known for its rich aroma, deep flavors, and regal presentation. It's a layered rice dish
    made by cooking spiced marinated chicken and fragrant basmati rice together using the 
    traditional dum (steam) method.

    This biryani stands out for its use of saffron, fried onions, mint, and a special blend of spices 
    that infuse every grain of rice with flavor. Often served with raita or salan, Hyderabadi Biryani 
    is a celebratory meal that brings both heritage and taste to the table.</p>
